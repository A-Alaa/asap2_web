Filtering out all genes which are zero in more than 95.0% of samples. To change this, change p0_thresh.
Warning: your Y matrix contains genes which are frequently zero. If the algorithm fails to converge, try filtering out genes which are zero more than 80 - 90% of the time, or using standard ZIFA.
